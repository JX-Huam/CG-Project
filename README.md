# Fundamental Computer Graphic project

This is a project done by a group of three with me as the leader.

This final project is aim to implement:
- 3D object modeling using combinations of 3D primitives
- hierarchical modeling
- proper camera
- lighting and shading model
- texture mapping
- interactivity by keyboard and mouse)
by using C++, Opengl and GLUT

We managed to create a 3D model of spongebob. The model parts can be moved using keyboard input. The main camera also can freely move using keyboard and mouse input. The surrounding wall of the model had implement texture mapping with pictures.
